## 1. Understanding Asymptotic Notation

**Big O Notation**  
Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s runtime as the input size grows. It allows us to:

- Compare algorithms independently of hardware
- Analyze scalability
- Focus on growth rate rather than exact runtime

## 2. Search Operation Scenarios

| Scenario         | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Best Case**    | The desired item is found immediately (e.g., at the first position) |
| **Average Case** | The item is found somewhere in the middle of the dataset            |
| **Worst Case**   | The item is not found or is the last element                        |

## 3. Time Complexity of Search Algorithms

### Linear Search

- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

### Binary Search

- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(log n)

## 4. Comparison and Suitability

| Criteria            | Linear Search     | Binary Search    |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Dataset Requirement | Unsorted          | Sorted           |
| Time Complexity     | O(n)              | O(log n)         |
| Use Case            | Small datasets    | Large datasets   |
| Maintenance         | No sorting needed | Requires sorting |

**Conclusion:**  
Binary search is more suitable for an e-commerce platform with a large product catalog, assuming data can be maintained in a sorted state. Linear search is acceptable for small datasets or quick, one-time operations on unsorted data.
